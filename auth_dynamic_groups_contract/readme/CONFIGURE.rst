On the tab page `Dynamic` you will be able to select the products that qualify
for membership of the group, if the partner has an active contractline for
that product.

Select `use` if you want to use a test based on contracts as one of possible
multiple conditions that must be satisfied for group membership. Select
`include` if you always want to include a user based on contracts, even if
other possible conditions are not met. Select `exclude` if you do NOT want
users with certain contracts in this group.
