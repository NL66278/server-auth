This module allows defining groups whose membership is a set dynamically.

This can be based on a condition expressed as python code or on the
categories attributes to the partner/user.

In addition this module allows for easy extention to add other methods to
determine group membership.

Finally a group can be marked as being filled automatically. For instance
groups that are maintained from an ldap connection can in this way be
prevented from manual editting.
