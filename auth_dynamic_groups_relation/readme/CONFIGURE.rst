On the tab page `Dynamic` you will be able to select the relation types
that qualify for membership of the group, if the partner has an active
relation of that type.

Select `use` if you want to use a test based on relations as one of possible
multiple conditions that must be satisfied for group membership. Select
`include` if you always want to include a user based on relations, even if
other possible conditions are not met. Select `exclude` if you do NOT want
users with certain relations in this group.
